> Hello, in this video I'll be introducing the topic of promises and
> will be giving an overview on what will be covered in this module. So,
> what is a promise? A promise is a container that holds the eventual
> result of an asynchronous operation. Promises are simple. You start
> off pending and eventually become either fulfilled or rejected. Once
> that occurs a value can be extracted out of the promise. Promises are
> becoming the standard way of handling asynchronous results. Before
> promises, callbacks were commonly used to handle asynchronous results.
> The problem with callbacks is that if there are too many of them
> chained together, the code becomes a pyramid of callbacks that is hard
> to read and hard to manage, especially when handling errors. On the
> other hand, promises are much easier to chain together and have a
> great way of handling errors. In this module, we will cover how to
> create a promise, how to use a promise, how to chain promises
> together, and how to handle multiple promises at the same time.
