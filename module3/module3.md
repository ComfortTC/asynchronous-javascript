> Hello, in this video I will be introducing the topic of the Fetch API
> and will be giving an overview on what will be covered in this module.
> The Fetch API is an interface built into the browser that allows users

> a much needed improvement over the XML HTTP request API, which was the
> previous method for making that work request. The XML HTTP request API
> required a lot of boilerplate code, which made it very hard to follow.
> Developers often used third party libraries such as jQuery to wrap the
> XML HTTP request API in a much more usable way. However, with the
> fetch API, developers now have an easy to use method for making
> network requests that doesn't require any external libraries. So how
> easy is it to use the Fetch API? Well, in its simplest form, all you
> need to use is the Fetch method and plug in the URL endpoint of your
> network request, and that's it. The Fetch method will return a promise
> that will hold a fetch response, and from that response you can obtain
> the data that you are trying to receive. See? Easy to use. In this
> module, I will be covering how to make a basic fetch call, how to send
> data with your fetch call, and how to handle fetch responses.

# Intro to Fetch

**Introduction to the Fetch API**

**What is the Fetch API?**

The Fetch API is an interface that is used to make network requests.

**Why is the Fetch API important?**

The Fetch API is a much needed improvement over `XMLHttpRequest`, the old API for making network request. The Fetch API is built 
into most modern browsers and also returns `Promises`.

What are we going to learn?

* How to use the `fetch()` method to make network requests
* How to extract data from fetch responses
* How to customize network request settings
* How to use Request objects to have more control over the `fetch()` method.
